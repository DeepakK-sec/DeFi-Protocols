**A beginner-friendly guide to understanding Decentralized Finance (DeFi) protocols – from ELI5 explanations to deeper technical dives.**

This repository is a living documentation project that explains how DeFi works, one protocol at a time. Whether you're completely new to crypto or an experienced developer looking for clear overviews, this guide aims to make complex topics accessible without dumbing them down.

## ELI5: What Are DeFi Protocols?

Imagine money stuff like saving, borrowing, or trading, but instead of going to a big bank with a boss who controls everything, it's all run by computer code on a super-secure shared internet called the blockchain. That's **DeFi** – Decentralized Finance.

**DeFi protocols** are like magic robot rulebooks (actually smart contracts) that anyone in the world can use with just a crypto wallet. No permission needed, open 24/7!

Some simple examples:
- **Swapping** → Trade crypto directly with others (like Uniswap – no middleman!).
- **Lending** → Lend your crypto and earn interest, or borrow by putting up collateral (like Aave).
- **Saving** → Pool money to earn yields (like Compound or Yearn).

It's like financial Lego blocks that anyone can plug together.

## Why This Guide?

- Starts with **ELI5-style explanations** for true beginners
- Progresses to **real mechanics**, examples, and composability
- Covers **benefits, risks, and security** honestly
- Community-driven – contributions welcome!

## How to Use This Repo

Just read the Markdown files! Start with the [Introduction](docs/introduction.md) if you're new. Each section builds on the previous ones, with simple analogies first, then more detail.

Diagrams, code snippets, and links to explorers/tools are included where helpful.

# Insurance in DeFi

DeFi insurance (often called "cover") protects your crypto from the unique risks of decentralized protocols — like smart contract hacks, oracle failures, stablecoin depegs, or even slashing penalties for stakers.

It's not perfect, but it's a growing safety net that gives peace of mind when putting money into DeFi.

## Why DeFi Needs Insurance

Traditional finance has FDIC insurance for banks and regulators watching over everything. DeFi has none of that — it's "code is law," and code can have bugs.

Common risks:
- **Smart contract exploits** → Hackers drain funds (happens multiple times a year).
- **Oracle manipulation** → Wrong price data causes bad liquidations.
- **Governance attacks** → Bad actors take over voting.
- **Stablecoin depegs** → Your "safe" dollar coin drops below $1.
- **Slashing** → Lose staked ETH for validator issues.

Insurance helps you recover if the worst happens.

## How DeFi Insurance Works

Most protocols use a **mutual** model:
- Users pool capital (like a group insurance fund).
- You buy "cover" by paying a premium (often 2–10% per year).
- If a covered event happens, you file a claim.
- Claims are voted on by members or assessed automatically.

Capital providers (underwriters) earn yield from premiums and sometimes governance tokens.

## Leading DeFi Insurance Protocols (Late 2025)

### Nexus Mutual
- The biggest and most established — capital pool around $180–$200M.
- Covers protocol hacks, custodian failures, depegs, slashing, and more.
- Community-voted claims (high payout rate historically).
- Recently integrated with Symbiotic for reinsurance layer to scale coverage.
- Requires membership (small fee + KYC) but very trusted.

### InsurAce
- Multi-chain support, portfolio-style coverage (insure multiple protocols at once).
- Lower premiums through diversification.
- Good for broader protection.

### Unslashed Finance

- Capital-efficient model.

### Others to Know
- **Neptune Mutual** → Parametric (auto-payouts on triggers).
- **Tidal Finance** → Customizable pools.
- **Ease / Bright Union** → Aggregators to compare and buy from multiple providers.

Nexus Mutual remains the leader by far in TVL and active coverage.

## Example: Buying Cover on Nexus Mutual

1. Go to nexusmutual.io
2. Become a member (one-time process).
3. Choose a product (e.g., Protocol Cover for Aave or Uniswap).
4. Enter amount you want protected and duration.
5. Pay premium → get cover active instantly.
6. If hack happens → file claim after cooldown → community assesses and pays out.

## Benefits

- Recover funds after exploits (Nexus has paid millions in real claims).
- Peace of mind for larger positions.
- Transparent and on-chain — see everything publicly.
- Some protocols let capital providers earn solid yields.

## Risks and Limitations

- **Not everything is covered** → Read terms carefully (e.g., no impermanent loss).
- **Claims can be denied** → Especially if event doesn't match exact criteria.
- **Underwriting risk** → If too many claims, pool could deplete (rare but possible).
- **Premiums add cost** → Reduces your overall yield.
- **Still small market** → Total coverage is tiny compared to DeFi TVL.

**Pro tip:** Only buy cover for positions you're worried about, and from battle-tested providers like Nexus.

## Quick Recap

DeFi insurance isn't as seamless as traditional insurance yet, but it's evolving fast. Nexus Mutual leads the pack and has proven it pays out when needed.

For most users, it's an optional layer of protection — especially useful for lending, staking large amounts, or using newer protocols.
